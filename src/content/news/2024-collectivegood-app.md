Sean Sylvia, along with UNC collaborators Joseph Tucker and Diane Pozefsky, developed CollectiveGood MD, a new mobile app that uses gamification and peer-sourced knowledge to build diagnostic skills.

Like Duolingo for diagnostics, the app helps improve access to basic medical knowledge in resource-constrained settings where informal healthcare providers often serve as the first point of contact for patients seeking care.

The platform represents a novel approach to improving healthcare quality in settings where formal training opportunities are limited. By making diagnostic learning engaging and accessible via mobile devices, CollectiveGood MD has the potential to reach providers who might otherwise lack access to continuing education.

This work connects to DHEPLab's broader research on collective intelligence approaches to improving healthcare quality, including our work on sentinel information markets and clinician-in-the-loop AI systems.

Sean Sylvia, PhD, was awarded $100,000 by Gillings Innovation Labs to pursue research titled "Utilizing Reinforcement Learning with Collective Expert Feedback to Advance the Use of Generative AI for Primary Care."

The grant is part of a competitive program funded by the $50 million Gillings gift to support cutting-edge research in generative artificial intelligence for public health. This project will explore how reinforcement learning techniques can be combined with expert clinical feedback to improve the accuracy and safety of AI systems in primary care settings.

The research aligns with DHEPLab's broader mission to develop rigorous methods for evaluating and improving clinical AI systems, ensuring they complement human expertise rather than replace it.

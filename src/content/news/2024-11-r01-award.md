We are thrilled to announce that DHEPLab has received an R01 award from the National Institutes of Health to study the implementation and clinical outcomes of AI-assisted diagnostic tools in primary care settings.

This five-year study will examine how machine learning algorithms for early disease detection perform across diverse patient populations and clinical environments. Working with health systems in North Carolina and beyond, we will assess both the technical performance of these tools and their real-world impact on care quality and health equity.

The project brings together expertise in health economics, implementation science, and clinical informatics to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating clinical AI systems.

We look forward to sharing updates on this important work as the project progresses.

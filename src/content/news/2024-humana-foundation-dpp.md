Sean Sylvia, PhD, and Tara Templin, PhD, have received a grant from the Humana Foundation to support research on community-based implementation of the CDC-recognized Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

The project, conducted in partnership with El Centro Hispano, examines how evidence-based diabetes prevention programs can be effectively implemented in community settings serving Latino populations in North Carolina.

## Research Focus

The study addresses critical questions about:

- **Cultural adaptation**: How the DPP curriculum can be adapted for cultural relevance while maintaining program effectiveness
- **Digital health integration**: The role of mobile health applications and digital tools in supporting participant engagement and behavior change
- **Health equity**: Strategies for reaching underserved populations who face elevated diabetes risk due to social determinants of health

## Community Partnership

This project represents a true community-academic partnership with El Centro Hispano, a grassroots organization dedicated to strengthening the Latino community in central North Carolina. The partnership ensures that research is community-driven and responsive to local needs.

## Impact

Findings from this study will inform best practices for community-based diabetes prevention and strategies for engaging underserved populations in preventive care—advancing both scientific knowledge and practical implementation.

The grant reflects the Humana Foundation's commitment to improving community health outcomes and addressing health disparities through innovative research partnerships.

Sean Sylvia has received an Innovation@Gillings grant for the "Mobile Information Market Platform for Community Disease Surveillance."

The project aims to enable community-driven early warning systems for disease outbreaks in resource-limited settings. By empowering residents in informal settlements as active participants in public health monitoring, the platform has the potential to detect disease threats weeks before traditional surveillance systems.

The mobile platform leverages information market mechanisms—where participants are incentivized to provide accurate information—to aggregate local health observations into actionable early warning signals. This approach represents a novel application of collective intelligence principles to public health surveillance.

This work builds on DHEPLab's research on information markets and collective intelligence approaches to improving healthcare delivery and population health monitoring.

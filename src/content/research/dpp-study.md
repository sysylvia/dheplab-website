## Overview

This study examines the implementation of the CDC-recognized Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in partnership with El Centro Hispano, a community organization serving Latino communities in North Carolina.

## Research Focus

### Community-Based Implementation

We study how evidence-based diabetes prevention programs can be effectively implemented in community settings:

- Adapting the DPP curriculum for cultural relevance
- Understanding barriers to participation and retention
- Measuring program effectiveness in real-world conditions

### Digital Health Integration

The study explores how digital tools can enhance community-based health programs:

- Mobile health (mHealth) applications for participant engagement
- Digital tracking of health behaviors and outcomes
- Telehealth components for program delivery

### Health Equity

A central focus is reaching underserved populations who face elevated diabetes risk:

- Addressing social determinants of health
- Reducing barriers to participation (language, transportation, scheduling)
- Culturally appropriate health education

## Partnership

This project represents a true community-academic partnership with El Centro Hispano, ensuring that research is community-driven and responsive to local needs.

## Impact

Findings from this study will inform:

- Best practices for community-based diabetes prevention
- Strategies for engaging underserved populations in preventive care
- Integration of digital health tools in community health programs

## Funding

This project is generously supported by the Humana Foundation as part of their commitment to improving community health outcomes.

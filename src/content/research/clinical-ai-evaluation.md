## Overview

Clinical AI systems are rapidly being deployed in healthcare settings, but methods for evaluating their real-world effectiveness lag behind. This research program develops rigorous approaches to assess AI-assisted clinical decision support from multiple perspectives.

## Key Research Questions

1. **How do we measure the true clinical impact of AI diagnostic tools?** Traditional performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, AUC) don't capture how AI changes clinician behavior or patient outcomes.

2. **What role does "soft ground truth" play in AI evaluation?** When even expert labels are uncertain, how should we calibrate and assess AI predictions?

3. **How do implementation factors affect AI effectiveness?** The same algorithm may perform differently depending on workflow integration, clinician training, and patient population.

## Current Projects

### Evaluating AI-Assisted Radiology
A multi-site study examining how AI diagnostic aids affect radiologist performance and patient outcomes in breast cancer screening.

### Soft Ground Truth Methods
Developing statistical approaches for evaluating AI systems when gold-standard labels are unavailable or uncertain.

### Implementation Science for Clinical AI
Qualitative and quantitative research on barriers and facilitators to effective AI implementation in clinical settings.

## Overview

Community health workers (CHWs) serve as critical bridges between formal health systems and underserved populations, particularly for maternal and child health in developing countries. Yet CHWs often lack the training, support, and tools needed to deliver high-quality, evidence-based interventions consistently.

This research program develops and evaluates digital platforms that empower CHWs to deliver structured, evidence-based curricula through home visits during pregnancy and early childhood. Our VisitLink platform combines mobile technology with rigorously designed content to improve health knowledge, behaviors, and outcomes.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Can mobile-delivered curricula improve CHW effectiveness?** Through randomized controlled trials, we measure the impact of structured digital content on health behaviors and outcomes.

2. **What features of digital CHW support are most effective?** By varying platform features, we identify which elements—scheduling, content delivery, tracking—drive improvements.

3. **How can curricula be adapted across contexts?** We study localization processes and content adaptation for different cultural, linguistic, and health system contexts.

4. **What is the cost-effectiveness of digital CHW interventions?** We conduct economic evaluations to inform policy and scale-up decisions.

## Current Projects

### China Randomized Controlled Trial
*Manuscript in preparation*

A large-scale RCT evaluating the Healthy Futures curriculum delivered through VisitLink in rural China, measuring impacts on maternal knowledge, health behaviors, and child developmental outcomes.

### Kenya Expansion
*In partnership with CFK Africa*

Feasibility assessment and potential pilot deployment of VisitLink in Kenya, including:

- Platform localization for Kenyan context
- Partnership development with local health systems
- Curriculum adaptation for local health priorities
- Cost and sustainability modeling

### Platform Architecture Research

Exploring the potential to transform VisitLink from a single-curriculum app to a platform architecture where content creators can build and share modular curricula for CHW delivery—creating a marketplace of evidence-based interventions.

## Methods

Our research employs:

- **Cluster randomized controlled trials** for rigorous impact evaluation
- **Mixed-methods implementation research** for understanding adoption
- **Human-centered design** for platform development
- **Cost-effectiveness analysis** for policy relevance
- **Modular curriculum design** for adaptability and scale

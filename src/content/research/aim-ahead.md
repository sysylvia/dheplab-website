## Overview

The AIM-AHEAD (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Researcher Diversity) project focuses on developing and evaluating clinical decision support tools that complement—rather than replace—human expertise in healthcare settings.

## Research Focus

Our work within AIM-AHEAD centers on:

### Clinician-in-the-Loop AI

We study how AI tools can be designed to augment clinical decision-making while preserving clinician autonomy and expertise. This includes:

- Understanding how clinicians interact with AI recommendations
- Identifying factors that influence appropriate vs. inappropriate reliance on AI
- Designing interfaces that support calibrated trust in AI systems

### Equity in Clinical AI

A core focus is ensuring that clinical AI tools work equitably across diverse patient populations:

- Evaluating algorithm performance across demographic groups
- Studying implementation factors that affect equity outcomes
- Developing methods for auditing clinical AI for bias

### AugMed Platform

A key output of this project is **AugMed**, our open-source experimental platform for running behavioral experiments with healthcare providers. AugMed enables:

- Vignette-based clinical decision studies
- Randomized experiments on AI tool design
- Measurement of diagnostic accuracy and response times
- Studies of human-AI interaction in medical settings

## Impact

This research informs the development of AI tools that are not only accurate but also usable, trustworthy, and equitable—ensuring that advances in clinical AI benefit all patients.

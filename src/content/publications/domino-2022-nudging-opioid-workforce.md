  Objective: To examine the responsiveness of primary care providers to pro-social and financial incentives to participate in a learning collaborative for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). Study setting: We conducted a statewide experiment in North Carolina from January 2019 to November 2019 to expand access to support for providers learning to treat opioid use disorder using different types of messaging and incentives. Study design: We randomly assigned 15,835 primary care providers (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) in North Carolina to receive one of four letters recruiting providers to participate in an online learning collaborative. Principal findings: We found a 47.5% greater response rate when pro-social messaging was included compared to when it was not.

abstract: |
  This analysis documents how the burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is shifting most rapidly toward lower-income countries. Using global health data, we show that while high-income countries have made substantial progress in reducing NCD mortality, low- and middle-income countries face accelerating epidemiological transitions with limited health system capacity to respond.

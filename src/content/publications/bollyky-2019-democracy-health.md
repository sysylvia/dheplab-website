abstract: |
  This study examines the association between a nation's experience with democracy and adult health outcomes. Using data from 170 countries over 36 years, we find that democratic governance is associated with significant reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality and other non-communicable disease outcomes, suggesting that political institutions play an important role in shaping population health trajectories.

abstract: |
  Digital network-based methods may enhance peer distribution of HIV self-testing kits. This three-arm randomized controlled trial evaluated whether monetary incentives and peer referral could improve secondary distribution of HIV self-testing among men who have sex with men in China, finding that both interventions significantly increased testing uptake and reached first-time testers.

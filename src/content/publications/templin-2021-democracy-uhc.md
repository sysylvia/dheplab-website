abstract: |
  This study examines the relationship between democratic governance and universal health coverage across countries. We find that democracies are associated with higher levels of health coverage compared to autocracies, even during periods of economic recession. These findings suggest that democratic institutions may provide important protections for public health investments during economic downturns.

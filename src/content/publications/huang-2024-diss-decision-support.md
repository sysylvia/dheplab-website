abstract: |
  Clinical decision support systems must balance comprehensive information with cognitive load. This paper introduces Dynamic Information Sub-Selection (DISS), a method for optimizing which information to present to clinicians during decision-making. DISS uses machine learning to dynamically select the most decision-relevant information, reducing cognitive burden while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy.

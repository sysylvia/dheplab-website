  Objectives: To test the impact of provider performance pay for anaemia reduction in rural China. Design: A cluster randomised trial of information, subsidies, and incentives for school principals to reduce anaemia among their students. Setting: 72 randomly selected rural primary schools across northwest China. Participants: 3553 fourth and fifth grade students aged 9-11 years. Interventions: Sample schools were randomly assigned to a control group or one of three treatment arms: (a) an information arm, (b) a subsidy arm, and (c) an incentive arm. Main outcome measures: Student haemoglobin concentrations. Results: Mean student haemoglobin concentration rose by 2.4 g/L in incentive schools compared with the control group, corresponding to a reduction in prevalence of anaemia.

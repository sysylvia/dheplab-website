abstract: |
  This study uses standardized patients (actors trained to portray patients with specific symptoms) to measure the quality of tuberculosis care provided by village clinicians and township health center physicians in rural China. The study reveals significant gaps in care quality and highlights the challenges of integrating infectious disease detection into primary care systems in low-resource settings.

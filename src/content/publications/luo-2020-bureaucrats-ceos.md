  This paper examines how monetary and non-monetary incentives interact in public organizations. Using a randomized controlled trial with school principals in China, we test whether high-powered financial incentives crowd out intrinsic motivation and pro-social behavior. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of performance pay depends critically on whether agents already have strong non-monetary motivations for performing well.

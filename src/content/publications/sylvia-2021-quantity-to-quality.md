abstract: |
  This paper evaluates the effectiveness of delivering early childhood development interventions through government health workers. Using a cluster randomized controlled trial in rural China, we test whether family planning cadres can effectively deliver a home-visiting parenting program to improve child development outcomes. The intervention significantly improved parenting practices and child cognitive and language development, demonstrating that government health workers can be trained to deliver evidence-based parenting programs at scale in resource-constrained settings.

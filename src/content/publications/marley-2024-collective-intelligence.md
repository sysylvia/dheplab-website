abstract: |
  Infectious disease surveillance is difficult in many low- and middle-income countries. Information market (IM)–based participatory surveillance is a crowdsourcing method that encourages individuals to actively report health symptoms and observed trends by trading web-based virtual "stocks" with payoffs tied to a future event. This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a tailored IM surveillance system to monitor population-level COVID-19 outcomes in Accra, Ghana. We designed and evaluated a prediction markets IM system from October to December 2021 using a mixed methods study approach. Using an IM system for disease surveillance is feasible and acceptable in Ghana. This approach shows promise as a cost-effective source of information on disease trends in low- and middle-income countries where surveillance is underdeveloped.

abstract: |
  State-level telehealth payment parity laws require equal reimbursement for telehealth and in-person visits. This study evaluates how payment parity affected utilization of disease-specific recommended care and emergency department services among insured patients with chronic mental health disorders and cardiometabolic risks, finding significant increases in psychotherapy visits and reductions in ED visits for mental health.

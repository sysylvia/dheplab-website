abstract: |
  This study examines the shifting burden of overweight and obesity from wealthy to poor populations in low- and middle-income countries. Using nationally representative household surveys from 103 countries, we document how the obesity epidemic is increasingly concentrated among lower socioeconomic groups, with significant implications for global health policy and resource allocation.
